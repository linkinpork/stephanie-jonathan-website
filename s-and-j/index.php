                            </div>
                            <p class="ourstory-para text-center"> Stephanie had made plans for a double-date dinner and board games on Saturday, April 14, 2012. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity, Jonathan used this hangout as a pretense for the proposal. Through her friend, Jonathan picked a nice restaurant in Malibu for dinner. Stephanie looked up the restaurant on Yelp and saw that it was a $$$ restaurant. Not wanting to go broke from dinner and secretly not wanting to go all the way to Malibu, Stephanie asked if they could go to a different restaurant. Jonathan had to play it cool and agreed with Stephanie&#39;s preference. Secretly though, Jonathan frantically emailed her friend to relay that Stephanie wanted a more economical choice. Instead of choosing a closer restaurant, her friend picked another less expensive restaurant in Malibu&#46;&#46;&#46;so a beach in Malibu for the proposal it was.
                                <br>
                                As usual, Stephanie had work that Saturday until 4:30, after which she met Jonathan to drive to Malibu together. Jonathan had no idea how he was going to get her to the beach without her noticing. To his relief and with some divine intervention, Stephanie passed out on the car ride to the &quot;restaurant.&quot; Little did she know that they had actually passed the restaurant on their way to the beach.<br>
                                <img src="/img/proposal/Proposal1.jpg" height="160" width="240" align="left"/>
                                As they pulled into the parking lot at the beach, Stephanie groggily asked where they were and Jonathan replied, &quot;That&#39;s weird, this is the address to the restaurant.&quot; Still in the process of waking up, Stephanie was confused but got out of the car and followed him down the path to the beach. &quot;I think it&#39;s somewhere down here&quot;&#46;&#46;&#46;&quot;Um&#46;&#46;&#46;are you sure it would be down here? ON the beach?&quot;
                                <br>
                                <img src="/img/proposal/Proposal2.jpg" height="160" width="240" align="right"/>
                                Stephanie&#39;s mind began to race thinking of the possibilities. A few steps later, Jonathan stopped abruptly and asked, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; pointing to something on the ground. Confused, Stephanie bent down to pick up the piece of paper and saw a drawing of a polar bear and walrus. Still puzzled, Stephanie looked up and saw that a trail of drawings leading up to a picnic blanket/basket. At that point, Stephanie knew exactly what was happening.  Each drawing  illustrated the story of their relationship and was from the book that Stephanie would eventually find at the end of the trail.
                                <br>
                                <img src="/img/proposal/Proposal3.jpg" height="160" width="240" align="left"/>
                                After speedily reading the book together, Jonathan reached into the picnic basket and pulled out a box. Her response was: &quot;You left that here by itself?!&quot; Jonathan then said some really nice things (that Stephanie cannot recall) and proposed! After the ring went on the finger, their friends started popping out from nowhere (at least to Stephanie). It turns out Jonathan didn&#39;t leave the ring by itself.

                            <p class="ourstory-para text-center"> Stephanie and I believe that marriage is from God and thus, it is ultimately for God. In other words, marriage is something God made and, although there are many blessings in it, it is primarily about God and not us. He created marriage to show the world an example of Jesus' love and commitment to His people (the church). By extending the love that we have experienced from Jesus to our spouse, we make a good name for God. Even though we're imperfect people, it's through the imperfections that we show how much Jesus loves us with all our imperfections and failures. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="ourstory-para text-center" style="font-style:italic"> "...We must say to ourselves something like this: 'Well, when Jesus looked down from the cross, he didn't think "I am giving myself to you because you are so attractive to me." No, he was in agony, and he looked down at us - denying him, abandoning him, and betraying him - and in the greatest act of love in history, he STAYED. He said, "Father, forgive them, they don't know what they are doing." He loved us, not because we were lovely to him, but to make us lovely. That is why I am going to love my spouse.' Speak to your heart like that, and then fulfill the promises you made on your wedding day."

                                <h4>Maid of Honor: Evangeline Lyu</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/evangeline.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="left" style="margin-right:30px;" />
                                <p>My biological sister, sister in Christ, oldest friend, and best friend. Our personality is as different as our physical appearance. Even though our relationship hasn&#39;t always been as great as it is today (sorry your room is green!!), I firmly believe God used it all for good to help us see how much we need Him and to gain a better understanding of His great love for us. Evangeline has seen some of my ugliest and most shameful moments, yet she still loves me. And though she is the younger sister, in many ways it would appear that she would be the older sister in this relationship. Throughout high school and to this day I steal her clothes. She would also be the one I went to when I needed my make-up done for school dances. Aside from the more superficial things, Evangeline is the protective younger sister that has always had my back and will stand up for me as if she were my older sister. I&#39;m so thankful how God has grown our sister-and-friend relationship through the years. Evangeline currently works at Jazz Kitchen in downtown Disney as the private events manager where she has access to unlimited beignets. She lives in Irvine with her dog-child Riley, enjoys cooking healthy (yummy) food, and working out. </p>
                                <h4 style="text-align:right">Bridesmaid: Julia Matsuoka</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/julia.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="right" style="margin-left:30px;" />
                                <p>Julia and I met at UCLA. My first impression of her was that we were very different and probably wouldn&#39;t click as friends. So even though we were in the same campus ministry and attended the same church throughout college, our friendship didn&#39;t really begin until my senior year, very much thanks to Julia being intentional. This was one of many instances in my life where I was so glad God showed me how wrong I was with my quick judgment. We started off with bonding over our common interest of running, baking, and eating, but the bond quickly grew to much more and it wasn&#39;t long before I knew I found one of my core friends-a friend that I can giggle with and be excited with over silly things as well as a friend that I can count on to speak truth gently, yet firmly, into my life. I am so thankful for the accountability and encouragement her friendship has, and continually, brings into my life. Julia currently works at NYU, lives in Brooklyn with her husband Stephen, and is aspiring to be pie master.</p>
                                <h4>Bridesmaid: Jackie Llarenas</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/jackie.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="left" style="margin-right:30px;" />
                                <p>Jackie and I met my freshmen year in high school through Monta Vista&#39;s girl&#39;s tennis team. However, our friendship in high school was confined to the context of tennis teamates for three years and then orchestra stand partners for one year. Even though we were not close friends in high school, I remember thinking very highly of Jackie and the mature way she carried herself throughout the chaos that is high school. She would occasionally remind me in casual ways of how God loved me, exhorting me to focus on Him rather than high school drama. We lost touch once we went to college until one fateful day in Westwood. I was working at Ralphs as a pharmacy technician when all of the sudden, Jackie pops up at the door. I was so taken aback to see her so randomly that I didn&#39;t even realize she wasn&#39;t at Ralphs as a shopping customer but as a pharmacist! Considering the circumstances at the time, our reconnection was a strong reminder of how amazingly and personally God works. I am so thankful God brought her back into my life and has given us the opportunity to continue spurring each other on towards Him. Jackie recently returned to Marina Del Rey from a year abroad in London with her husband Andrew. She is a pharmacist at Ralphs Pharmacy by day and a TasteMade video maker by night.</p>
                                <h4 style="text-align:right">Bridesmaid: Beatrice Pak</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/bea.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="right" style="margin-left:30px;" />
                                <p>Bea and I became friends in 8th grade from hanging out in the same circle of friends. Our group of friends changed by high school, but we remained close friends and saw each other through some of our highest and lowest moments during our teenage years. We ended up at opposite ends of the country for college but somehow reunited in Los Angeles where we were roomates for one great year. Even though we have both grown to be very different people from our junior high days, Bea is still one of my most loyal friends who I know I can count on for a very honest and direct opinion. Bea currently works at Vidal Sassoon as a stylist (She is also my personal stylist :) ). She recently relocated back to the Bay Area after living in SoCal for 3 years and is enjoying the fresh crisp air, traffic free roads, and time with her family and nephew/niece. </p>
                                <h4>Bridesmaid: Stephanie Ou</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/stepho.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="left" style="margin-right:30px;" />
                                <p>Stepho and I met freshmen year in high school through our super cool class (orchestra!), and quickly became good friends. We have seen each other through our rollercoaster high school days, and Stepho has definitely seen me through some of my most embarrassing moments and even takes credit for my nickname throughout high school. Aside from sharing the same first name, we also share the same high school, college, and grad school alma mater. Needless to say, we have gone through many adventures together both in NorCal and SoCal throughout the years and even conquered Half Dome together. It has been awesome seeing how our friendship continues to grow as we go through different chapters of our lives. Stepho is currently in the MATTC (Masters in Teaching and Teaching Credential) program at Santa Clara University. She lives in the Bay Area and loves to craft and bake. </p>
                                <h4 style="text-align:right">Bridesmaid: Aimee Li</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/aimee.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="right" style="margin-left:30px;" />
                                <p>Even though I only met Aimee a few years ago, I feel like I have known her for so much longer. We met at the beginning of pharmacy school. I remember being excited to meet another fellow Bruin during orientation and grabbing her arm amidst the hecticness of trying to take a class picture. Little did I know then how important her friendship would become as we proceeded through pharmacy school. Though we bonded through the hard times of pharmacy school (7AM study parties) and work, our friendship quickly grew beyond the boundaries of pharmacy school. I am so thankful for her friendship and know that pharmacy school, work, and life in general would not have been the same without her! Aimee is also finishing up her last year at USC pharmacy school (yay!). She works at Kaiser Permanente, lives in the San Gabriel area, and enjoys going on adventures to different countries (or adventures to try different cuisines from different countries...same thing). </p>

                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">
                                <h4>Best Man: Ryan Weng</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/ryan.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="left" style="margin-right:30px;" />
                                <p>Growing up, I was a pretty terrible older brother to Ryan. It&#39;s not that we fought incessantly or anything; in fact, it was quite the opposite. I remember him often wanting to hang out with my friends throughout middle and high school&#46;&#46;&#46;and each time, I felt I was too cool for him and either didn&#39;t let him come with me or ignored him when he did come along. I didn&#39;t realize until later just how poorly I had treated him. When I finally started treating him as a friend and peer, rather than just my little brother, we grew much closer. It&#39;s unfortunate that shortly after I realized this I started college; however, we were still able to maintain our relationship through our semi-weekly phone conversations over sports, anime, and God. Ryan is one of the most caring people I know and will often put others&#39; needs above his own. I&#39;m proud and blessed to be his brother. Ryan works as a private equity analyst and enjoys spending time with his friends and family. </p>
                                <h4 style="text-align:right">Groomsman: Eric Yau</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/eric.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="right" style="margin-left:30px;" />
                                <p>Eric and I first met at church during Chinese school on Friday nights. Our parents tried to orchestrate events so that we could become friends, but those never seemed to pan out. It wasn&#39;t until we started maturing in our relationship with Jesus that our acquaintance developed into friendship. Not everything was smooth-sailing from there though. In fact, I remember butting heads quite often arguing about whatever (nerdy) video game we were playing at the time. While we&#39;ve had our differences, it was his love for God and desire to obey Him (along with his goofiness and quirkiness) that drew me to him and led me to greatly respect him. My fondest memories with Eric are summer nights spent lounging around at his home, talking and praying for each other. Eric is recently married to Kathleen, loves serving the youth, and enjoys tinkering and home improvement projects. </p>
                                <h4>Groomsman: Romin Bahk</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/romin.jpg" height="230" width="230" align="left" style="margin-right:30px;" />
                                <p>I owe it Romin for putting up with countless hours of chick flicks and Disney movies (though he was partially compensated with baked goods). He&#39;s been there from the start of my relationship and earned the title of &quot;official third wheel.&quot; My friendship with Romin extends back to high school where we took several classes together. When we came to UCLA, we got to know each other a lot better because I was one of the few people he already knew. My fondest memories with Romin come from living together--from late-night runs to Monterey Park for Chinese food to playing XBOX with our roommates, it&#39;s safe to say we never got any real work done. Romin is one of the most passionate and enthusiastic (talkative) guys that I know. You know that Romin won&#39;t be afraid to speak the truth, even if it&#39;s something you don&#39;t want to hear, but he also won&#39;t hesitate to stick up and defend you if he senses that you&#39;ve been wronged. Romin is the director of a tutoring/after-school center and pursuing pastoral ministry. </p>
                                <h4 style="text-align:right">Groomsman: James Yang</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/james.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="right" style="margin-left:30px;" />
                                <p>James and I were in the same small group our freshman year at UCLA. As with many forced friendships, things started awkwardly. One of the first things I learned about him was that he was an avid aquascaper--I had no clue what that was until meeting him. Aquascaping aside, I also noticed a deep desire to know God more. Seeing this, I knew I wanted to be life-long friends. When I share with James he&#39;s easily able to identify and empathize with me and always seems to have a timely word of encouragement or exhortation for me. I know that God has blessed me greatly through James. He&#39;s the kind of person who&#39;s able to genuinely share in your joys and sorrow. James is currently pursuing a master&#39;s degree in civil/geo-engineering while working part time at a geotech firm. He is heavily involved with his church and is an ardent Dodgers fan. </p>
                                <h4>Groomsman: Henry So</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/henry.jpg" height="220" width="220" align="left" style="margin-right:30px;" />
                                <p>I got to know Henry my first year at UCLA in an Asian American studies class. By a strange series of events, we ended up dorming together our second year. One of the most unique things about Henry is that he is the most logical person I know. Because he thinks so differently from me, he&#39;s given me a different and valuable perspective in many of the big decisions I&#39;ve had to make. While he may be logical, he is no robot. He&#39;s prayed with me through the ups and downs when Stephanie and I were dating. I&#39;ve had the privilege of being one of his groomsmen at his wedding and, I guess, this is his turn. Henry is married to Jung Hwa, enjoys good food and Bruins football. </p>
                                <h4 style="text-align:right">Groomsman: Mark Sheng</h4>
                                <img src="/img/weddingparty/mark.jpg" height="225" width="225" align="right" style="margin-left:30px;" />
                                <p>It&#39;s really quite interesting how Mark and I are friends. Besides our relationship with Jesus and our love for the 49ers, we don&#39;t really share that many interests. We grew up together at church and went to the same high school, but I didn&#39;t get to know him very well until a mission trip to Mexico. Before that, he was just the &quot;cool&quot; guy I knew in high school. It was in Mexico where I witnessed his desire to serve Jesus and love others and carried deeper conversations with him. Mark is also a really goofy and easy-going guy, something I appreciate since it&#39;s always super relaxing spending time with him. Mark is currently pursuing a Doctor of Pharmacy degree at that-school-across-town (USC) and enjoys finding new places to eat. This being said, it may mean that we can&#39;t really discuss college football (the Bruins are better)&#46;&#46;&#46; </p>
